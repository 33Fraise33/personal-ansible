# accweb server and application configuration.
# https://github.com/assetto-corsa-web/accweb

webserver:
  # Sets the host and port.
  # Port 80 is the default port for web servers and might be blocked on your maschine.
  # If that is the case you can use anything else like 8080 for example.
  # 0.0.0.0 exposes accweb on the internet.
  host: 0.0.0.0:8080

  # Set tls to true and provide paths to the key files in order to enable SSL.
  # This is highly recommended as otherwise your passwords and all other traffic won't be encrypted!
  # accweb will probably support automatic Letsencrypt certificates in the future.
  tls: false
  cert: path to ssl certificate
  private_key: path to ssl private key

  # http write/read timeouts
  # technical stuff you shouldn't mess around with
  write_timeout: 5
  read_timeout: 5

auth:
  # Set the admin, moderator and read only user password.
  # accweb won't start without an admin password.
  admin_password: {{ accweb.admin_password }}
  moderator_password: {{ accweb.mod_password }}
  read_only_password: ro

  # Optional path to public and private token key files. If you need to store the private/public keys used to
  # sign the session token (the JWT) in a specific location (or have existing keys in a specific location), you
  # can define those here.
  #
  # accweb now generate these with a default path if not configured.
  #
  # public_key_path: secrets/token.public
  # private_key_path: secrets/token.private

acc:
  # Path to ACC server installation directory.
  # Use forward slashes (even if you're on Windows!). The example path is for Linux.
  server_path: "/accserver/server/"

  # Name of the server executable within the server installation directory.
  # You don't need to change this (except the ACC devs change its name for some reason).
  server_exe: accServer.exe
